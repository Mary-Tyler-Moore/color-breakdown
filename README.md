# Vibrant GUI

[Vibrant GUI](https://notwoods.github.io/vibrant-gui) is [node-vibrant](https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant)'s missing GUI, aiming to expose the configuration options of node-vibrant. node-vibrant ports the [Android Palette class](https://developer.android.com/training/material/palette-colors.html) to JavaScript, allowing you to extract prominent colors from images. Use these colors in your own designs to create more visually engaging designs and apps.

Inspired by [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)!
