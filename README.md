# Vibrant GUI

[Vibrant GUI](https://notwoods.github.io/vibrant-gui) is [node-vibrant](https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant)'s missing GUI, aiming to expose the configuration options of node-vibrant. Inspired by [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)!

# Feature requests
It's early days for this project, so it's missing important features such as code output view & detailed options for each plugin. [Check out the issues](https://github.com/NotWoods/vibrant-gui/issues) to see what's planned, or suggest ideas of your own!
